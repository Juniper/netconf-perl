=head1 NAME

Net::Netconf::Access::ssh

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The Net::Netconf::Access::ssh module is used internally to provide SSH access to
a Net::Netconf::Access instance, using Net::SSH2.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of Net::Netconf::Access class that manages an SSH connection
with the destination host. The underlying mechanics for managing the SSH
connection is based on Net::SSH2.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

new($ARGS)

Please refer to the constructor of Net::Netconf::Access class.
